# ProductCatalog
According to your project I implemented the following project using following tools:
-Entity Framework Code First approac
-asp.net 4.7.2 webapi/jQuery
I attached the following files:
	dbo.Products.data.sql
	dbo.Suppliers.data.sql
	you will fid them on root and in ProductCatalog\App_Data
to insert some data for testing
database sql not needed as I developed app using EF Code first approach
just modify Connection string in web.config and app.config
note: Connection String is provided in all projects in solutions so once you modifiy it in one you have to keep in mind to edit others as well
i used both MVC and WebApi together to give you channce to evaluate me on both technologies :)
working hours arround 10 to 12
